This repository contains programming assignments from the Scientific Computing course. Below is a summary of each assignment:

- **01: Matrix Operations and Performance Analysis**
  - Implementation of matrix operations such as multiplication, similarity checks, and generating rotation matrices, without relying on specific built-in NumPy functions.
  - Methods for measuring the performance of these operations and determining machine epsilon â€” the smallest difference a computer can distinguish between two numbers.

- **02: Solving Linear Systems and Tomographic Reconstruction**
  - Solutions for systems of linear equations using techniques like Gaussian elimination and Cholesky decomposition, implemented without specific NumPy utilities.
  - Functions for setting up and solving tomographic reconstruction problems, enabling image creation from measurement data.

- **03: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Face Recognition**
  - Implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction and face recognition tasks.
  - Includes calculations of eigenvectors, loading and processing images, projecting data into a PCA basis, and identifying faces in test images using trained datasets.

- **04: Interpolation Techniques**
  - Implementation of various interpolation methods, including:
    - Lagrange interpolation
    - Hermite cubic interpolation
    - Natural cubic spline interpolation
    - Periodic cubic spline interpolation

- **05: Signal Processing with Fourier Transforms**
  - Construction and application of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrices and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  - Tasks include creating and transforming delta impulse signals, generating tone signals, and applying low-pass filters to process signals.
